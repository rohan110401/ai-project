# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

Diabetes has proven to be the most common disease in aged people since decades irrespective
of ethnicity, gender or physique. Accurate predictive measures are crucially essential to avoid
further serious immunity consequences. We plan to solve this problem using non-traditional
methods involving various machine learning algorithms providing the maximum accuracy over
the manual testing methodologies hence eliminating the factor of human error.
